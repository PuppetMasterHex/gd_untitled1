# Skills

Skills are combat techniques that can be executed at the expense of SP.  
Some Skills may also combine a weapon with magic to form a magical attack.  
Most Skills can be used with different weapon type, e.g. a skill may require [Whips](items.md#whips) at level 12 and [Fire](magic.md#fire) at level 9 to execute [Fire Whip](#fire-whip).
